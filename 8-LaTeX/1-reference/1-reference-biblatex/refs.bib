  abstract      = {The heats of formation of stable and metastable phases of the Nb–Si and Mo–Si systems were studied using density functional theory (DFT). The high-temperature behavior of the competing phases was studied by performing additional phonon calculations. Our theoretical results rationalize the major differences observed in the behavior of the Nb–Si and Mo–Si systems: Nb3Si is only stable at temperatures above 2043K, whereas Mo3Si is always stable; Nb5Si3 and MoSi2 undergo phase changes at elevated temperatures, in contrast to Mo5Si3 and NbSi2. These differences are qualitatively explained by including the vibrational entropy to the free energies within the harmonic approximation. In particular, the softer shear moduli of the Nb5Si3 and MoSi2 \ensuremath{\beta}phases cause their stabilities over the \ensuremath{\alpha} phases at elevated temperature.}

  abstract      = {Niobium--silicon (Nb--Si)-based superalloys have attracted attention as potential super high-temperatures materials for hot-end components of next-generation high-thrust-to-weight aero-engines due to their high melting points, excellent high-temperature strength, and low densities. The multi-component alloying strategy was often adopted but required expensive experiments, and previous calculations mainly studied the single-component alloying effects for efficiency. This work focused on the multi-component alloying effects on the stability and mechanical properties of Nb and Nb--Si alloys. The first-principles density functional calculations were performed to study the preference of phase and site occupations of 14 alloying elements, including main group elements: B, Al, Si, and transition metal elements: 3d (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni), 4d (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo), and 5d (Hf) in Nb and $\alpha$-Nb5Si3, respectively. The 3059 multi-component configurations up to quaternary systems, including 315 Nb and 2744 \$\alpha\$-Nb5Si3 models, respectively, were studied considering both single-site and double-site substitutions. The single-site substitution energy calculations indicate that Si, Al, Ni, Mo, and Co were single-site Nb phase stabilizers while Ti, Zr, B, and Hf alone stabilized \$\alpha\$-Nb5Si3 phase. The synergetic effects of the double-site substitution elements caused Ti, Fe, Zr, Hf, and V becoming the additional Nb phase stabilizers as well as V as \$\alpha\$-Nb5Si3 phase stabilizer. Moreover, we calculated the elastic constants and mechanical properties of the 33 most stable Nb alloys. The comprehensive evaluation on the stability and mechanical properties indicated that the overall performance decreased in the order of Mo, Si, Co, and Ni as the leading substitution elements in the 2nd nearest neighbor substitution pairs. The medium-strength and high-plasticity systems had the best overall mechanical performance with SiFe, SiMo, SiCr, AlFe, and NbSi substitutions. Finally, we proposed a ``Stability--Plasticity--Strength'' (SPS) strategy for computational alloy design of multi-component Nb--Si alloys.},

  abstract      = {High entropy alloys (HEA), a novel class of materials with multiple principal elements, allow us to tune the properties within a wide composition range where the solid-solution phase is stable. However, it is difficult to experimentally determine the boundaries of the single-phase region. In this paper, we calculate the phase diagram of the CrMoNbV quaternary system, as well as its constituent binary and ternary subsystems, using a combination of the cluster expansion method and CALPHAD calculations. We further verify these results by carrying out experiments at two different compositions of the full quaternary system. Our work shows how these computational tools can enable efficient discovery and development of new HEAs.}

  abstract      = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are designed for high elevated-temperature strength, with both edge and screw dislocations playing an important role for plastic deformation. However, they can also display a significant energetic driving force for chemical short-range ordering (SRO). Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying the mobilities of screw and edge dislocations in the body-centered cubic MoNbTaW RHEA over a wide temperature range using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on a highly-accurate machine-learning interatomic potential. Further, we specifically evaluate how these mechanisms are affected by the presence of SRO. The mobility of edge dislocations is found to be enhanced by the presence of SRO, whereas the rate of double-kink nucleation in the motion of screw dislocations is reduced, although this influence of SRO appears to be attenuated at increasing temperature. Independent of the presence of SRO, a cross-slip locking mechanism is observed for the motion of screws, which provides for extra strengthening for refractory high-entropy alloy system.},
